The purpose of this function is to read data from a CSV file, manipulate the schema of the data, and then save it as a Parquet file with specific settings.\n\n1. `dummy_df = pl.scan_csv(csv_file)`: This line reads the CSV data from the `csv_file` using the Polars library and stores it in a DataFrame called `dummy_df`. This DataFrame is essentially a table that holds the CSV data.\n\n2. `new_schema = {}`: This line initializes an empty dictionary called `new_schema`. This dictionary will be used to define a new schema for the DataFrame with specific column types.\n\n3. `for key, value in dummy_df.schema.items():`: This line starts a loop that iterates over the columns of the `dummy_df` DataFrame and their corresponding data types in the schema.\n\n4. `if key.startswith(\"reactivity\"):`: Within the loop, this line checks if the column name (`key`) starts with the string \"reactivity.\" If it does, it means that this column is related to reactivity, and we want to change its data type.\n\n5. `new_schema[key] = pl.Float32`: If the column name starts with \"reactivity,\" this line updates the `new_schema` dictionary to set the data type of that column to `Float32`. This conversion is done because Parquet requires specific data types for its columns.\n\n6. `else:`: If the column name does not start with \"reactivity,\" this line executes when dealing with columns other than those related to reactivity.\n\n7. `new_schema[key] = value`: For columns that are not related to reactivity, this line simply copies the existing data type from the original schema to the `new_schema` dictionary.\n\n8. `df = pl.scan_csv(csv_file, schema=new_schema)`: After defining the new schema, this line reads the CSV data from `csv_file` again but uses the `new_schema` to define the data types for the columns. The resulting DataFrame `df` now has the desired schema.\n\n9. `df.sink_parquet(...)`: This line writes the data from the DataFrame `df` to a Parquet file specified by `parquet_file`. It includes some additional settings:\n   - `compression='uncompressed'`: It specifies that the Parquet file should not be compressed, which makes it easy to access but may result in a larger file size.\n   - `row_group_size=10`: It sets the row group size for the Parquet file to 10. Row groups are a way to divide the data in a Parquet file, and this parameter allows you to control the size of those groups.\n\nThis code reads a CSV file, modifies the schema for specific columns, and then saves the data to a Parquet file with customizable settings.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def to_parquet(csv_file, parquet_file):\n    # 📊 Read CSV data using Polars\n    dummy_df = pl.scan_csv(csv_file)\n\n    # 🔍 Define a new schema mapping for specific columns\n    new_schema = {}\n    for key, value in dummy_df.schema.items():\n        if key.startswith(\"reactivity\"):\n            new_schema[key] = pl.Float32  # 📊 Convert 'reactivity' columns to Float32\n        else:\n            new_schema[key] = value\n\n    # 📊 Read CSV data with the new schema and write to Parquet\n    df = pl.scan_csv(csv_file, schema=new_schema)\n    \n    # 💾 Write data to Parquet format with specified settings\n    df.sink_parquet(\n        parquet_file,\n        compression='uncompressed',  # No compression for easy access\n        row_group_size=10,  # Adjust row group size as needed\n    )\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T19:26:00.789863Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T19:26:00.790513Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T19:26:00.796020Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T19:26:00.790486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T19:26:00.795141Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📝 Convert training and test CSV data to Parquet format\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"to_parquet(TRAIN_CSV, TRAIN_PARQUET_FILE)  # 🚆 Training data\nto_parquet(TEST_CSV, TEST_PARQUET_FILE)    # 🚀 Test data\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T19:26:08.030341Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T19:26:08.030676Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T19:28:49.762942Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T19:26:08.030652Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T19:28:49.761728Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📝 Define a function to generate nearest adjacency matrix\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Explaination**:\n\nThis code defines a Python function called `nearest_adjacency` that generates adjacency information for elements in a sequence. It calculates the neighbors of each element within a given range, considering both positive and negative offsets. The code includes support for circular connections if `loops` is set to `True`. \n\n1. `base = np.arange(sequence_length)`: This line creates a NumPy array `base` containing integers from 0 to `sequence_length-1`. This array represents the sequence of elements for which adjacency is being calculated.\n\n2. `connections = []`: This initializes an empty list `connections` where the adjacency information will be stored.\n\n3. `for i in range(-n, n + 1):`: This starts a loop that iterates through a range of values from `-n` to `n`, inclusive. This loop considers neighbors within a specified range around each element.\n\n4. `if i == 0 and not loops:`: This checks if `i` is equal to 0 (indicating the current element itself) and if `loops` is set to `False`. If both conditions are met, it continues to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the case where an element is considered its own neighbor.\n\n5. `elif i == 0 and loops:`: This handles the case where `i` is equal to 0, but `loops` is set to `True`. In this case, it creates circular connections by stacking the `base` array on top of itself. This ensures that each element is connected to itself.\n\n6. `neighbours = base.take(range(i, sequence_length + i), mode='wrap')`: For non-zero values of `i`, this line calculates the neighbors of each element. It uses the `take` method to index the `base` array with values wrapped around using the `mode='wrap'` parameter. This creates circular connections for positive and negative offsets.\n\n7. `stack = np.vstack([base, neighbours])`: This stacks the `base` array and the `neighbours` array vertically to create a matrix where each row represents an element and its neighbors.\n\n8. The `if` and `elif` blocks handle separating connections for positive and negative offsets. If `i` is negative, it appends the connections starting from the `i`-th column to the end of the matrix. If `i` is positive, it appends the connections from the beginning of the matrix up to the `i`-th column.\n\n9. `connections.append(stack)`: This appends the `stack` matrix, representing the adjacency information for a specific offset `i`, to the `connections` list.\n\n10. After the loop, the code combines all the adjacency matrices in the `connections` list horizontally using `np.hstack(connections)` and returns the result. This matrix represents the combined adjacency information for all elements in the sequence, considering the specified range and circular connections as needed.\n\nIn summary, this code generates adjacency information for a sequence of elements, allowing for circular connections and customizable neighbor ranges. It returns a matrix where each row corresponds to an element, and columns represent its neighbors within the specified range.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def nearest_adjacency(sequence_length, n=2, loops=True):\n    base = np.arange(sequence_length)\n    connections = []\n\n    for i in range(-n, n + 1):\n        if i == 0 and not loops:\n            continue\n        elif i == 0 and loops:\n            stack = np.vstack([base, base])\n            connections.append(stack)\n            continue\n        \n        # 🔄 Wrap around the sequence for circular connections\n        neighbours = base.take(range(i, sequence_length + i), mode='wrap')\n        stack = np.vstack([base, neighbours])\n\n        # Separate connections for positive and negative offsets\n        if i < 0:\n            connections.append(stack[:, -i:])\n        elif i > 0:\n            connections.append(stack[:, :-i])\n\n    # Combine connections horizontally\n    return np.hstack(connections)\nprint(nearest_adjacency(10, n=1, loops=False))\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T19:50:14.063746Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T19:50:14.064120Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T19:50:14.072574Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T19:50:14.064089Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T19:50:14.071625Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📏 Define the edge distance for generating adjacency matrix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"EDGE_DISTANCE = 4 #Edge distance for generating adjacency matrix.\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-30T19:31:30.450915Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-30T19:31:30.451280Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-30T19:31:30.456058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-30T19:31:30.451252Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-30T19:31:30.454848Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 📊 Define a custom dataset class for a simple graph dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Explaination**:\n\nThis code defines a PyTorch dataset class called `SimpleGraphDataset` for working with graph data where nodes have one-hot encoded sequence information and target values.

It follows a typical training loop structure and monitors training and validation loss and mean absolute error (MAE) for each epoch. \n\n1. `n_epochs = 15`: This line defines the number of training epochs, which is the number of times the entire training dataset will be processed by the model during training.\n\n2. `optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0003, weight_decay=5e-4)`: Here, an Adam optimizer is defined with the following settings:\n   - `model.parameters()`: It specifies the model's parameters that the optimizer will update during training.\n   - `lr=0.0003`: This sets the learning rate, controlling the step size during optimization.\n   - `weight_decay=5e-4`: Weight decay is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.\n\n3. `for epoch in range(n_epochs):`: This loop iterates over the specified number of training epochs.\n\n4. `train_losses = []` and `train_maes = []`: These lines initialize empty lists to store training losses and mean absolute errors for each batch in the training dataset.\n\n5. `model.train()`: This sets the model in training mode, which can be important for certain layers or operations that behave differently during training and inference (e.g., dropout, batch normalization).\n\n6. The next inner loop iterates over batches in the `train_dataloader` using the `tqdm` progress bar for visualization. The code within this loop performs the following steps for each batch:\n\n   - `batch = batch.to(device)`: It moves the batch of data to the specified computing device (e.g., CPU or GPU) to utilize hardware acceleration.\n\n   - `optimizer.zero_grad()`: This resets the gradients of the model's parameters to zero before computing gradients for the current batch.\n\n   - `out = model(batch.x, batch.edge_index)`: It passes the input data (`batch.x` and `batch.edge_index`) through the model to get predictions (`out`). The specific model architecture and input structure depend on the problem.\n\n   - `out = torch.squeeze(out)`: This squeezes any unnecessary dimensions from the output tensor.\n\n   - `loss = loss_fn(out[batch.valid_mask], batch.y[batch.valid_mask])`: It calculates the loss between the model's predictions (`out`) and the ground truth targets (`batch.y`) but only for the valid data points (where `batch.valid_mask` is `True`).\n\n   - `mae = mae_fn(out[batch.valid_mask], batch.y[batch.valid_mask])`: Similarly, this calculates the mean absolute error (MAE) between predictions and targets for valid data points.\n\n   - `loss.backward()`: This computes gradients for the model's parameters with respect to the loss.\n\n   - `train_losses.append(loss.detach().cpu().numpy())` and `train_maes.append(mae.detach().cpu().numpy())`: These lines append the loss and MAE values (converted to NumPy arrays) for the current batch to the respective lists.\n\n   - `optimizer.step()`: This performs a parameter update using the computed gradients.\n\n   - `pbar.set_description(f\"Train loss {loss.detach().cpu().numpy():.4f}\")`: This updates the progress bar description to display the current training loss.\n\n7. After processing all batches in the training dataset, the code prints the average training loss and MAE for the current epoch.\n\n8. `val_losses = []` and `val_maes = []`: Similar to the training phase, these lines initialize empty lists to store validation losses and MAEs.\n\n9. `model.eval()`: This sets the model in evaluation mode, which disables operations like dropout during evaluation.\n\n10. The inner loop now iterates over batches in the validation dataset using the `val_dataloader`. It follows the same steps as the training loop but calculates and stores validation loss and MAE.\n\n11. After processing all validation batches, the code prints the average validation loss and MAE for the current epoch.\n\nThis code represents a typical training loop for supervised learning with neural networks, tracking model performance over multiple epochs and optimizing model parameters using gradient descent with the Adam optimizer. It also handles GPU acceleration if available (`batch = batch.to(device)`). .","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"n_epochs = 15\n\n# 📈 Define the optimizer with learning rate and weight decay\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0003, weight_decay=5e-4)\n\n# 🚂 Iterate over epochs\nfor epoch in range(n_epochs):\n    train_losses = []\n    train_maes = []\n    model.train()\n    \n    #
